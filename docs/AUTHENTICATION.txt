Setup
-----

    First, make sure to load "kcb.js" from the backend - this will supply a global object 
    called (very originally) "KCB". 

Authenticating
--------------

    In order to authenticate, you'll have to show a modal (or another UI bit) that has 
    buttons for the provided authentication mechanisms. Currently, only facebook. On button
    click, you can then:

    function clickFacebook() {
        KCB.authenticat('facebook');
    }

    The second parameter is a relative URL to return the user to once signin is complete.

    These methods will cause a redirect to take place to the backend, which will then redirect
    to the proper site for user authentication. 

    Once authentication is complete, the process redirects back to the tenant domain and
    passes a 'status' parameter along with it. If status is set to 'ok' authentication was
    successful, if set to 'error' authentication failed. 

    When authentication failed, you can examine the KCB.lastAuthenticationError property 
    to get the error code. 


Checking if a user is authenticated and getting user object
-----------------------------------------------------------

    KCB.isAuthenticated()   - returns true when the user is authenticated, false if not
    KCB.getUser()           - returns the user object
